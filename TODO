8) reorganize for multiple-isa support
   
   break libmint in libll and libmintmips

   libll.     should contain only generic stuff, nothing here should be
   simulation platform specific.

   libmintmips should contain the MIPS-specific stuff for the function
   simulation.

   libmintppc is coming.... not sure when! ;-)

swifthWidth on power (renamed)

7) Subdurectory in lib directory
 
 creation of .depends: SIGNATURE is something like lib*.* and path to
 files should be something like lib*/*. e.g. libpower/cacti

________________________________________________________________________

All the includes should be placed in alphabetical order.

5) Platform selection

 Remove the Makefile.defs.ARCH

 Use configure options to select the following parameters:


# LINUX
# LENDIAN (little endian)

# Linux
DEFS	+=-DLINUX -DLENDIAN -DPOSIX_MEMALIGN

# Darwin
DEFS	+=-DDARWIN


CXX	=g++
CC	=gcc

LOPTS
COPTS


ARFLAGS	:=cr
SHELL	=/bin/sh
AS	=as
LD	=ld
AR	=ar
M4	=m4
MAKE	=make
RANLIB	=ranlib
FIND	=find

Fussion Instruction.h and icode.h, it should represent a sesc
internal instruction independent of the encoding (MIPS, PPC).
libmint and libtrace can have their internal representation.

Lazy Instruction translation?

If we have a cache, it will not be necessary to translate everything
at the beginning. This is useful if we want to have something like
pearPC. Otherwise, it will be impossible to have binary load.
