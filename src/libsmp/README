This directory implements the memory backend of an SMP
system. The implementation assumes some simplifications:

1) SMPCache should be used as a private inclusive L2. It shouldn't be
too hard to make SMPCache work as an L1 (any candidates?). Make it
work as a shared cache my be a little more complicated (any
candidates?).

2) L1 (from Cache.cpp) used with SMPCache has to be write-through.

3) MSHR has to be non-aliasing, guaranteed (this means you shouldn't
use the full mshr, which allows aliasing; single mshr is recommended).

4) Data movement is not modeled (only control messages), although it
is not too complicated to add the data messages (any candidates?).
